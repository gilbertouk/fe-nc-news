> Northcoders News Front-End: This project is a single page application built using React JS with a responsive mobile-first design, making request to an RESTful API to serve news articles and vote/comment with optimistic rendering and error handling.

> Please note: The application may take a few minutes to load as it waits for the backend to respond due to the BE hosting service shutting down after periods of inactivity.
